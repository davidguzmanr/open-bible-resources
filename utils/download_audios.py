Download Utility for Bible TTS Resources
=========================================

This module provides utilities for downloading and extracting Bible TTS audio
resources from artifact links. It handles:

1. Parsing HTML files to extract artifact download links
2. Downloading files with progress indication
3. Extracting ZIP archives with progress tracking
4. Batch processing of multiple resources

def extract_artifact_links(html_file_path: str) -> Dict[str, Dict[str, str]]:
    """
    Parse an HTML file and extract artifact download links with their sections.

    Supports two HTML formats from the open.bible site:

    - Old format: sections are ``<li>`` elements with an ``<a class="opener">``
      heading and a ``<div class="slide">`` containing the artifact links.
    - New format (Next.js SSR): sections are ``<div role="region">`` elements
      whose previous sibling ``<h3>`` carries the section name; artifact links
      are plain ``<a href="https://...artifactContent/...">`` tags inside a
      ``<ul>`` list.

    In both cases the function maps each book/resource name (link text) to its
    download URL and enclosing section (e.g. "New Testament - mp3").
    Word-document links are skipped in both formats.

    Args:
        html_file_path: Path to the HTML file containing artifact links.

        A dictionary mapping artifact names (link text) to a dict containing:
            - "url": The download URL
            - "section": The section/header the artifact belongs to
