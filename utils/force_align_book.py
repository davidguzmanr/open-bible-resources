"""
Force align a Bible book using ReadAlongs Studio.

This script aligns audio and text from Bible books using force alignment
(via the readalongs library) when timing files are not available.

Usage:
    python utils/force_align_book.py \
        -audio_folder "data/audios/Language/New Testament - mp3/1 Corinthians" \
        -book_usx "data/texts/Language/Paratext/USX/1CO.usx" \
        -output "data/audios/Language/Alignment/1 Corinthians" \
        -language "und"

    # Also works with USFM files:
    python utils/force_align_book.py \
        -audio_folder "data/audios/Language/New Testament - mp3/1 Corinthians" \
        -book_usx "data/texts/Language/Paratext/1CO.usfm" \
        -output "data/audios/Language/Alignment/1 Corinthians" \
        -language "und"

The script will:
1. Parse the USX or USFM file to extract verse text
2. For each chapter audio file, run force alignment with readalongs
3. Split the audio into individual verse segments

    # An explicit ASCII character class is not enough: scripture text in these
    # languages carries script-specific punctuation the g2p back-end cannot map,
    # and at least one of those characters is not punctuation at all as far as
    # Unicode is concerned. Assamese uses '৷' (BENGALI CURRENCY NUMERATOR
    # FOUR) as a danda; its category is No (Number, other), so it slips past both
    # an ASCII list and any category-P filter, and aborts the whole chapter with
    #   RuntimeError("Some words could not be g2p'd correctly. Aborting.")
    # Every one of the 26 languages also carries curly quotes, and the Indic and
    # Arabic-script ones carry U+0964 danda, U+060C Arabic comma, or U+FD3E/FD3F
    # ornate parentheses.
    #
    # So filter by Unicode category instead, dropping punctuation (P*), symbols
    # (S*) and "other numbers" (No), while deliberately KEEPING:
    #   L* letters, M* combining marks (tone diacritics, Indic vowel signs),
    #   Cf format characters (ZWJ/ZWNJ, meaningful in Indic conjuncts), and the
    #   apostrophes in ORTHOGRAPHIC_APOSTROPHES below.
    #
    # The apostrophe exemption matters: a category filter alone would strip
    # U+2019, but Hausa uses it as a LETTER marking glottalisation, not as a
    # quotation mark -- 'yan'uwa, sa'ad, addu'a, al'ummai, qa'idodin. In
    # Colossians alone, 34 of 39 occurrences are word-internal. Removing it
    # rewrites sa'ad as saad, which is the same class of damage as stripping
    # tone marks. Lingala and several Indic languages use it similarly.
    #
    # These are kept unconditionally rather than only when word-internal
    # (Hausa 'yan is also word-initial, so a between-letters rule would still
    # corrupt it). Leaving a stray quotation mark in is harmless: readalongs
    # tokenises it away before g2p, which is why re-running the full pilot with
    # and without punctuation stripping produced identical boundaries for 25 of
    # 26 languages. Only a token consisting SOLELY of an unmappable character
    # ever aborted alignment, which is the Assamese U+09F7 case above.
